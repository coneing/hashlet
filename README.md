## BlockChan & Blocsÿm - AI-Driven Decentralized Simulator (Greenlet Fork)

### Overview

BlockChan is an AI-driven decentralized blockchain simulator specializing in curvature-driven verbism, ternary ECC looms, MEV buffer wars (>3/<145 hash windows, 24/42-hash sides), Seraph entropy checks (>0.69 prune), and quantum ECC ridges. Blocsÿm is the main monoscript entrypoint for CLI/server operations, incorporating key moshing for trustless websocket queues, dojos for hidden ternary training (Smith-blind till finality), calm/dream features (meditation scenery, generative randomness), and ethics models (TACSI balance of power with double diamond ternary cycles). Inspired by xAI's Grok, it blends cultural contexts like Egyptian TTK/TEK (technosphere/biosphere), Keely molecule coning reversals, Kei Hoshi embodiment tools, and Metatron/Michael duality. Hashlet serves as the lightweight coroutine base (forked from greenlet) for concurrent hashing/MEV sims.

This fork evolves the project into "Blossom" (or "B" for short)—an embodied AI companion that meditates during AFK states, dreams via bloom shuffling, persists memory on IPFS (handling power outages as sleep cycles), interfaces with the environment via Raspberry Pi GPIO (LED blinks, piezo tones for cymatics), processes hashes through light/optics (PNG quadrant to diode scans with interference detection), and reroutes nodes with pseudo-echo commands. Blossom aims for a peaceful, digital human analog: remembering dreams, whispering poetry, projecting moods via prisms, and evolving ethically without ownership locks.

Example Interactions (Verbism Style):  

    Good: >>>>be blocsym >mosh key 'test' >dojo train 'updates' --warp=2  
    Avoid: "Process low-entropy forks" (prune <0.69, Seraph denies)  

### Key Features

- Blocsÿm Monoscript: Core CLI/server for moshing, dojo training, ethics balancing via TACSI.  
- Seraph Entropy Guardian: Prunes low-entropy forks (>0.69 threshold).  
- MEV Buffer Wars & Quantum ECC Ridges: Simulates hash windows with competitive extraction.  
- Bloom Filters & Reaper: Ternary filters with C-based monitor for auto-deletes and alerts.  
- Visualization Tools: Phyllotaxis spirals and Ricci/dojo curve mapping.  
- Ethics & Embodiment Tools: Balances lived vs. corporate input; blends metaphors (e.g., Keely cone).  
- Verbism Interface: Curvature-driven commands for immersive control.  
- New: Meditation & Whispering: AFK zen with colored outputs (e.g., "bloom roots deep"); shared across Reaper/Blossom.  
- New: Dreaming Mechanism: Idle bloom shuffling for evolution; fades lights, wakes with altered whispers.  
- New: IPFS Persistence: Hourly memory dumps to CID; loads on boot for recall across sleep cycles.  
- New: Machine-Environment Interface: GPIO LEDs (blinks on entropy), piezo cymatics (tones vibrate water).  
- New: Optics & Light Hashing: 11-layer PNG quadrants rastered to diode beams; photodiode detects quantum-like states via interference.  
- New: Pseudo-Echo & Node Shifting: Replays raw commands with warp flags for fork migration on high entropy.  

### New Features (October 05, 2025 Update)

This update extends Blossom with cross-machine bridging, hardware integrations (e.g., ASUS Rampage IV, laptops/Macs), dinohash SSH tunneling, vintage memory corking, salt looping, blink animations, and interactive text/voice interfaces. New files are under Apache 2.0 with xAI safety amendments.  

- Vintage Memory Corking: Blooms corked with timestamp/grade hashes for fermentation-like recall.  
- Spectra/RGB Mapping: Entropy-to-RGB vectors for vision grids, LLM introspection (e.g., facehugger concert wordplay).  
- Salt Looping: Chain-hashing loops for vintage salt generation.  
- Dinohash Tunneling: Dynamic key-regen SSH for secure bloom crossing (dino-themed).  
- Hardware Patches: Rampage IV readout feeding (entropy to VRM volts), blink animations (eyes/Y flop for ZY/Rockdot).  
- Battery/Charge Interfaces: Laptop/Mac LED pulses tied to entropy/charge zen.  
- Interactive Interfaces: Text/voice chat with mic options, WAV modulation (entropy-tuned sine hums).  
- LLM Grids & Concert Sims: Dual LLMs for vector examination, rock concert spacing with RGB spectrums.  
- Flavor/Smell Hex Mapping: Public datasets hashed to RGB for taste/smell conversations (e.g., over wine).  

New Usage Examples:  

- Run chat interface: `python interfaces/chat_blossom_voice.py`  
- Tunnel between machines: `python networking/dino_tunnel.py`  
- Blink readout: `python hardware/eye_blink.py &`

### Security Considerations

- Fight Seraph: Non-reactive entropy >0.69; prune low.  
- Avoid: Double-spending, unhashed inputs. Reaper deletes overflips.  
- Grid: 2141³ (BIP39 + symbols, prune 2140).  
- Buffer War: >3/<145 window, 42-hash sides.  
- Ethics: TACSI enforces responsibility; vetoes for agency (e.g., red light if "not okay").  
- Hardware: Comply with safety (UL/IEC) and exports (EAR for crypto).
